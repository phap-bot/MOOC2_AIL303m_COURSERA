Machine Learning (ML) Overview

Machine Learning (ML) allows computers to learn from data rather than relying on explicitly programmed instructions.

In traditional statistics, we understand the underlying process → we can build a model that fits it.

In machine learning, the process is often unknown or too complex → the algorithm learns the relationship from data (function approximation).

Artificial Intelligence (AI) – broader concept

Based on Russell & Norvig’s four quadrants:

Rows: thinking vs acting
Columns: human-like vs rational

Machine Learning fits in the “thinking” area (machines that learn → can reason, decide, act).

Depending on the goal:

Marketing → simulate human thinking (how people react).

Supply chain → aim for rational thinking (optimize decisions).

Key Idea – Learning as the Core

“Learning” is the foundation of all intelligent behavior — from decision-making to perception and reasoning.

Model Concept

A model is a simplified representation of something larger (like a map of a territory).

A good model:

Omits unimportant details.

Keeps essential relationships and structures.

Balances complexity reduction and information preservation.

Example: a map shows borders and water bodies but not every landmark — enough to understand spatial relations.

Applications of ML in Daily Life

Spam filtering (classify emails).

Web search ranking.

Route optimization (logistics).

Fraud detection.

Movie recommendation systems.

Many more — increasingly common and ongoing.
